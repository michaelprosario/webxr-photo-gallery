As a user, I need a FAST API to import photos from a particular folder into my archive of photos.
- fast api should be implemented using python
- I should be able to specify a folder to import images from
- The system should reduce the images to size that's reasonable for web application download
- make a nice readme to teach me how to install the software
- photo archive should be stored using file system and folders
- I should be able to give the imported files a collection name

====

Add api to generate a aframeScene
- This use case should use google gemini for scene generation
- aframeScenes should be stored in sceneOutput folder
- api should specify a list of collection names
- Using https://aframe.io/, create an art gallery scene for my collection of photos from each collection
- Art inspiration: Light, warm summer tuskin. Airy, 80s
- Add other geometric shapes to make the art gallery artful
